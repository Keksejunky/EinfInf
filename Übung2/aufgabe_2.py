# Write a program that checks if a word is contained in a dictionary
# Part A: write a function find_pos which accepts a string and a character and returns the position of the character in
#         the string if it exists and if it doesn't exist it returns -1
# Part B: write a function that converts the dictionary to a text file which only contains the words
# Part C: write a program that accepts a word and outputs the line number of the word in the new dictionary if it is
#         contained in the dictionary.
